# multicity-weather-dashboard

## Summary
In this assignment, we were given the task of creating a multi-city dashbard. When a user searches for a city,
the page is supposed to load current weather data and a 5 day forecast. In order to achieve this goal, we had to utilize our existing knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and Bootstraps. The added layer to this assignment was to be able to access server side api's to return the information needed. This was done by using the Open Weather API in conjuntion with AJAX calls.
